# Problem 3 - Printing Out all Available Letters
# 10.0 points possible (graded)
# Next, implement the function getAvailableLetters that takes in one parameter - a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function returns a string that is comprised of lowercase English letters - all lowercase English letters that are not in lettersGuessed.
# Example Usage:
# >>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
# >>> print(getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed))
# abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz
# Note that this function should return the letters in alphabetical order, as in the example above.
# For this function, you may assume that all the letters in lettersGuessed are lowercase.
# Hint: You might consider using string.ascii_lowercase, which is a string comprised of all lowercase letters:
# >>> import string
# >>> print(string.ascii_lowercase)
# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
# Code Editor

getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed):
    '''
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: string, comprised of letters that represents what letters have not
      yet been guessed.
    '''
    # FILL IN YOUR CODE HERE...
    import string # import library string for string methods
    available = list(string.ascii_lowercase) # string.ascii_lowercase is a STRING comprised of all lowercase letters, and we are turning it into a LIST!
    for letter in lettersGuessed: #if the letter has been ussed
        available.remove(letter) # we remove it from available
    return ''.join(available) # we join shortened list into a string of letters separated by space ''
