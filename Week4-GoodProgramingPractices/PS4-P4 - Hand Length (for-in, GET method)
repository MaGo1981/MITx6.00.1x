#Problem 4 - Hand Length

#We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. We'll be implementing the playHandfunction. 
#This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to implement the helper 
#calculateHandlen function, which can be done in under five lines of code.
