# Problem 2 - Paying Debt Off in a Year

# Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.
# In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.
# The following variables contain values as described below:
# 1.	balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
# 2.	annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal
# The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example:
# Lowest Payment: 180 
# Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:
# Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
# Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)
# Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance

# Hints
# Hint: How to think about this problem?
# •	Start with $10 payments per month and calculate whether the balance will be paid off in a year this way (be sure to take into account the interest accrued each month).
# •	If $10 monthly payments are insufficient to pay off the debt within a year, increase the monthly payment by $10 and repeat.

# Hint: A way of structuring your code
# •	If you are struggling with how to structure your code, think about the following:
# •	Given an initial balance, what code would compute the balance at the end of the year?
# •	Now imagine that we try our initial balance with a monthly payment of $10. If there is a balance remaining at the end of the year, how could we write code that would reset the balance to the initial balance, increase the payment by $10, and try again (using the same code!) to compute the balance at the end of the year, to see if this new payment value is large enough.
# •	I'm still confused!
# A good way to implement this problem will be to use a loop structure. You may want to refresh your understanding of while loops. Think hard about how the program will know when it has found a good minimum monthly payment value - when a good value is found, the loop can terminate.
# •	Be careful - you don't want to overwrite the original value of balance. You'll need to save that value somehow for later reference!
