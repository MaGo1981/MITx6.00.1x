Problem 9
1 point possible (ungraded)

Write a function to flatten a list. The list contains other lists, strings, or ints.
For example, [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5] is flattened into [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5]

def flatten(aList):
'''
   '''
   aList: a list
   Returns a copy of aList, which is a flattened version of aList
   '''

Click to expand Hint: How to think about this problem
Recursion is extremely useful for this question. You will have to try to flatten
every element of the original list. To check whether an element can be flattened, t
he element must be another object of type list.

Paste your entire function, including the definition, in the box below. Do not leave
any debugging print statements. Note that we ask you to write a function only -- you cannot
rely on any variables defined outside your function for your code to work correctly.
