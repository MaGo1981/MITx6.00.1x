Problem 6

Implement a function that meets the specifications below.

def deep_reverse(L):
'''
   """ assumes L is a list of lists whose elements are ints
   Mutates L such that it reverses its elements and also
   reverses the order of the int elements in every element of L.
   It does not return anything.
   """
   # Your code here

'''
For example, if L = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]] then deep_reverse(L) mutates L to be [[7, 6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]]

Paste your entire function, including the definition, in the box below. Do not leave any debugging print statements.

# Paste your function here






BEFORE EMAILING THE STAFF: Please read carefully. The question states that you need to mutate L. Your code must work when you do this:

L = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [10, -10, 100]]
deep_reverse(L)
print(L)
